***AddEverythingToCollection***

This is a very blunt tool for when you want to add a lot of cards to a collection:
On the edit-collection page it checks every checkbox and sets focus to the 'save' button.
It adds the keybind 'n' or 'N' to go to the next page.



***Card Gift Keybinds***

This adds keybinds to the gift-page:
When a key is pressed, the corresponding nation name is filled in the text-field and the 'gift' key gets focus.
Edit the 'moustrap.bind' lines to add, remove or alter keybinds.


***TotalFinds***

This script displays, on the finds_history page, the total number of finds of the card and the percentage of those cards still in existence.


***DeckPageBids&MVCss***

Changes and repositions the "market value" and "Bid amounts" displayed on cards when opening packs.
For better visibility.
